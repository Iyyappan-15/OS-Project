name: "OS Scheduler Visualizer"
description: >
  An interactive web-based Operating System Scheduler Visualizer that simulates
  First Come First Serve (FCFS) and Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithms 
  with memory allocation and Gantt chart visualization.

features:
  - "🎯 Scheduling Algorithms: FCFS, SJF"
  - "📦 Process Management: Add PID, Burst Time, Memory Requirement"
  - "🎨 Unique color coding for each process"
  - "📊 Real-time Gantt Chart Visualization"
  - "💾 Memory Allocation with adjustable total memory"
  - "🌓 Dark/Light Mode toggle"
  - "⏯️ Controls: Start, Pause, Resume, Reset"

project_structure:
  - "index.html  # Main app (HTML, CSS, JS)"
  - "README.md   # Documentation"

how_to_run:
  steps:
    - "Clone the repository"
    - "Open index.html in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)"
    - "Add processes and run the simulation"

usage:
  - "Enter Process ID, Burst Time, and Memory Required"
  - "Set Total Memory and choose scheduling algorithm (FCFS or SJF)"
  - "Click Start to begin simulation"
  - "Use Pause / Resume / Reset controls as needed"

tech_stack:
  - "HTML5"
  - "CSS3 (Glassmorphism, Animations, Dark/Light Mode)"
